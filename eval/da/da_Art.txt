nd we don't know where it comes from. Evolutionary biologists are excited to figure out what causes what we see out there--the relative forces of selection and drift--whether things are adapting to their environment or variation is random..."
2005-07-05, Sciencedaily: Trees, Vines And Nets -- Microbial Evolution Changes Its Face Citat: "... EBI researchers have changed our view of 4 billion years of microbial evolution...In all, more than 600,000 vertical transfers are observed, coupled with 90,000 gene loss events and approximately 40,000 horizontal gene transfers...A few species, including beneficial nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, appear to be 'champions'of horizontal gene transfer; "it's entirely possible that apparently harmless organisms are quietly spreading antibiotic resistance under our feet," concludes Christos Ouzounis..."

2005-11-11, Sciencedaily: Lateral Thinking Produces First Map Of Gene Transmission Citat: "...Their results clearly show genetic modification of organisms by lateral transfer is a widespread natural phenomenon, and it can occur even between distantly related organisms... it was assumed that transfer of genes could only be vertical, i.e. from parents to offspring..."
