 the daddy o,
Whack fol the daddy o,
There’s whisky in the jar.
The gold and silver coins, they looked so bright and shiny,
Oh, I took them home straightway, and I gave 'em to my Molly;
She vowed and she promised that she never would deceive me,
But the devil’s in the women, oh, you never can believe 'em.
(Chorus)
But when I awoke between six and seven,
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even;
I reached for my pistols, but alas, I was mistaken;
My pistols had been fired, and a prisoner I was taken.
(Chorus)
They put me in the jail without judge or writin',
For robbing Colonel Pepper, oh, on Kilgary Mountain,
But they didn’t take my fists, so I knocked the sentry down,
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town.
(Chorus)
Some people take delight in fishin' and in bowlin';
Oh, others take delight in the carriages a-rollin';
But I take delight in the juice of the barley,
And courtin' pretty girls 'til the morning so early.
