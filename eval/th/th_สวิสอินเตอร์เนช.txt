 in autumn 2007 and were not new-build aircraft, but rather former Swissair aircraft that were leased out for six years.
In addition to SWISS' own fleet a number of codeshare agreements are currently in effect. These include 3 Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Swiss airline Helvetic Airways, two Fokker 100 operated by Lufthansa Regional partner Contact Air, one BAe 146-300 operated by British airline Flightline (UK), and one Saab 2000 operated by Swiss regional airline Darwin Airline. These aircraft operate from Zurich on routes to Birmingham, Manchester, Prague, Brussels, and Lugano.
On 20 September 2007, Lufthansa confirmed an order for 41 aircraft. Two of the ordered A320 and the 9 orders for A330 aircraft are intended for Swiss.
One MD-11 aircraft formerly used by Swiss had the Chinese character Ruì (瑞), from the Chinese translation of Switzerland, Ruìshì (瑞士), on the tail fin instead of the cross. It came from the former Swissair subsidiary Swissair Asia, which was formed to allow for Swissair to serve the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China [2].
