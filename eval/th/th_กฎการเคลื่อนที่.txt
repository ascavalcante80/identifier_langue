and get

and

Differentiate

twice:

Substitute into the radial equation of motion

and get

Divide by 

These solutions are

where  and  are arbitrary constants of integration. So the result is

Choosing the axis of the coordinate system such that , and inserting , gives:

If  this is Kepler's first law.


=== กฎเคปเลอร์ข้อที่ 3 ===

where:
T = planet's sidereal period
r = radius of the planet's circular orbit
G = the gravitational constant
M = mass of the sun

โดย:
T = object's sidereal period
a = object's semimajor axis
G = the gravitational constant = 6.67 × 10−11 N • m²/kg²
M = mass of one object
m = mass of the other object

Q.E.D.
