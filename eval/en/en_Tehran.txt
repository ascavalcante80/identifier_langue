have been built in recent decades in order to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830.
Tehran International Tower, the tallest residential building in Iran, is a 54-story building located in the northern district of Youssef Abad. Appealing to the principle of a vertical rather than horizontal expansion of the city, the Tehran International Tower is bound to the North by Youssef Abad, to the South by Hakim Highway, to the East by Kordesstan Highway and to the West by Sheikh Bahai Highway, all of which provide easy access to other parts of the city.
Azadi Tower, a memorial built during the Pahlavi period, has long been the most famous symbol of Tehran. It was constructed to commemorate the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire, and combines elements of the architecture of the Sassanid and Achaemenid eras with Post-Islamic Iranian architecture. Milad Tower, the sixth tallest tower and the 17th tallest freestanding structure in the world, is the city's second landmark tower. Leila Araghian's Tabiat Bridge, the largest pedestrian overpass in Tehran, was completed in 2014 and is considered as the third symbolic building of the city.


=== Graffiti ===

Many styles of graffiti are seen in Tehran. Some are slogans painted by governmental organizations, which are mostly about the Revolution of 1979, and some are works of art by citizens, representing themes such as protest, freedom and peace.
During the protests of the Iranian presidential election of 2009, many graffiti art works were created by people supporting the Green Movement. They were removed from the walls by the Basij forces.
In recent years, Tehran Municipality has been using graffiti in order to beautify the city. Several festivals have also been held to celebrate graffiti art in Tehran. One of them was held in October 2014, organized by the Tehran University of Art.


=== Cuisine and restaurants ===

Tehran has many modern and traditional restaurants and cafes, serving both traditional Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. One of the most popular dishes of the city is chelow kabab. Pizzerias, sandwich shops and kebab shops make up the majority of food outlets in the city.


=== Performing arts ===

During the Qajar era, Tehran was home to the royal theater of Tekye Dowlat located at the southeast of the Golestan Palace, in which traditional and religious performances were observed. It was destroyed and replaced with a bank building in 1947, following the modernization of Tehran under the reign of Reza Shah of the Pahlavi Dynasty.
Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become the most famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes in the Middle East, with the Roudaki Hall of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet. The hall was inaugurated by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Empress Farah on October 26, 1967, and now continues to operate with Vahdat Hall as its official name. It is home to the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the Iranian National Ballet Company.
The City Theater of Tehran was opened in 1972, with its main building designed by architect Ali Sardar Afkhami, and contains several performance halls.

The first movie theater of Tehran was established and opened by Mirza Ebrahim Khan in 1904. Until early 1930s, there were 15 theaters in Tehran Province and 11 in other provinces.
There are many movie theaters in Tehran, with most of them located downtown. The complexes of Mellat Cinema and Gallery, Azadi Cinema, and Cinema Farhang are among the well known cinema complexes in Tehran.
Festivals such as Fajr International Film Festival, Fajr International Music Festival, Fajr International Theater Festival, International Puppet Theater Festival of Tehran, and Tehran International Animation Festival are also observed in the city.


=== Sports ===

Tehran was the first city in the Middle East to host the Asian Games. The 7th Asian Summer Games was held in Tehran in 1974, with the participation of 2,363 athletes and officials from 25 countries.
Football and volleyball are the city's most popular sports, while wrestling, basketball, and futsal are also major parts of the city's sporting culture.

12 ski resorts operate in Iran, the most famous being Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours from the city of Tehran.
Tochal Ski Resort is the world's fifth highest ski resort at over 3,730 meters (12,240 ft) above sea level at its highest point. It is also the world's nearest ski resort to a capital city. The resort was completed in 1976, shortly before the 1979 Revolution.

Tochal is equipped with a 8-kilometre-long (5 mi) gondola lift which covers a huge vertical distance. There are two parallel chair ski lifts in Tochal that reach 3,900 meters high (12,795 ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000 m/13,125 ft), rising higher than the gondola's 7th Station. This altitude is higher than any of the European ski resorts.
From the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the 5,610-metre-high (18,406 ft) Mount Damavand, a dormant volcano. Located at the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is the Tochal Hotel, located at 3,500 metres (11,483 ft), where a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 metres (12,500 ft) of Shah-Neshin peak.

The first football club of Tehran was founded in 1920 and named the Iran Club, which was dissolved in 1923. Currently, the oldest football club in the city is Rah Ahan Crystal F.C. which was founded in 1937. The city has hosted the final of the 1968 AFC Asian Cup and the 1976 AFC Asian Cup. Persepolis and Esteghlal, which are the city's biggest clubs and two of the biggest clubs in Asia, compete in the Tehran derby.
Tehran is also the site of Iran's national football stadium at the Azadi Complex, which has a capacity of 100,000. Azadi Football Stadium is one of the largest stadiums in the world, where many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held. In 2005, FIFA ordered Iran to limit spectators allowed into the Azadi Stadium because of a fatal crush due to inadequate safety procedures. Other stadiums in Tehran include the Dastgerdi, the Takhti Stadium, and the Shirudi Stadium.
Tehran is host to five major football clubs in the Iran Pro League, namely:
