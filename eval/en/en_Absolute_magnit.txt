cal unit (AU) from both the Sun and the observer. Because the object is illuminated by the Sun, absolute magnitude is a function of phase angle and this relationship is referred to as the phase curve.
To convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57. A comet's nuclear magnitude (M2) is a different scale and can not be used for a size comparison with an asteroid's (H) magnitude.


=== Apparent magnitude ===
The absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.

where  is 1 AU,  is the phase angle, the angle between the Sun–body and body–observer lines. By the law of cosines, we have:

 is the phase integral (integration of reflected light; a number in the 0 to 1 range).
Example: Ideal diffuse reflecting sphere. A reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies

A full-phase diffuse sphere reflects 2/3 as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter.
Distances:
 is the distance between the observer and the body
 is the distance between the Sun and the body
 is the distance between the observer and the Sun
Note: because Solar System bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors, astronomers use empirically derived relationships to predict apparent magnitudes when accuracy is required.


==== Example ====
Moon:
 = +0.25
 =  = 1 AU
 = 384.5 Mm = 2.57 mAU
How bright is the Moon from Earth?
Full moon:  = 0, ( ≈ 2/3)

(Actual −12.7) A full Moon reflects 30% more light at full phase than a perfect diffuse reflector predicts.

Quarter moon:  = 90°,  (if diffuse reflector)

(Actually approximately −11.0) The diffuse reflector formula does for smaller phases.


== Meteors ==
For a meteor, the standard distance for measurement of magnitudes is at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) at the observer's zenith.
