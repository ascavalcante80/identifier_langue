 browsers have these user interface elements in common:
Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous resource and forward respectively.
A refresh or reload button to reload the current resource.
A stop button to cancel loading the resource. In some browsers, the stop button is merged with the reload button.
A home button to return to the user's home page.
An address bar to input the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the desired resource and display it.
A search bar to input terms into a search engine. In some browsers, the search bar is merged with the address bar.
A status bar to display progress in loading the resource and also the URI of links when the cursor hovers over them, and page zooming capability.
The viewport, the visible area of the webpage within the browser window.
The ability to view the HTML source for a page.
Major browsers also possess incremental find features to search within a web page.


=== Privacy and securityEdit ===

Most browsers support HTTP Secure and offer quick and easy ways to delete the web cache, download history, form and search history, cookies, and browsing history. For a comparison of the current security vulnerabilities of browsers, see comparison of web browsers.


=== Standards supportEdit ===
Early web browsers supported only a very simple version of HTML. The rapid development of proprietary web browsers led to the development of non-standard dialects of HTML, leading to problems with interoperability. Modern web browsers support a combination of standards-based and de facto HTML and XHTML, which should be rendered in the same way by all browsers.


=== ExtensibilityEdit ===
A browser extension is a computer program that extends the functionality of a web browser. Every major web browser supports the development of browser extensions.


== ComponentsEdit ==
Web browsers consist of a user interface, layout engine, rendering engine, JavaScript interpreter, UI backend, networking component and data persistence component. These components achieve different functionalities of a web browser and together provide all capabilities of a web browser.
