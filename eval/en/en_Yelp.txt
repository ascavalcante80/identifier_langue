eclining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.
San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken is producing a new documentary film Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.

According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers") are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike. Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location, or by praise and attention from other users. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the businesses political views; Yelp attempts to filter these. Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool." Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users. According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18â€“25 or "suburban baby boomers".
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos. Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews. Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad. They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected. Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member. The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005, and in 2006 it was formally codified; the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad." Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks. Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews. As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews. In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws. In 2014 a US law was passed that prohibited businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts of terms or use that allege they can sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners. Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so. After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped", while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".
