es are gradually substituted with nutrients seeping in from the mother's reproductive tract.
In many ways, viviparity can be more strenuous and more physically and energetically taxing on the mother than oviparity. However, its numerous evolutionary origins signify that there must be worthwhile benefits to this mode of reproduction in some scenarios, as well as selective pressures that allowed it to convergently evolve over 150 times in vertebrates. One of the most profoundly advantageous features of viviparity is thermoregulation of the embryo. Since the developing offspring remains within the motherâ€™s body, she becomes, in essence, a walking incubator. This is very useful when climate change imposes cooler average temperatures on a current habitat, or when a migration event necessitates adaptation to a new, cooler environment. When considering squamate reptiles in particular, there is a correlation between high altitudes or latitudes, colder climates and the frequency of viviparity. This tendency for egg-retention, and consequently viviparity, to be selectively favored under cooler conditions due to its thermoregulatory benefits is termed "the cold climate hypothesis."
