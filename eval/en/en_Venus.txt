The United States' Magellan spacecraft was launched on 4 May 1989, with a mission to map the surface of Venus with radar. The high-resolution images it obtained during its 4 1⁄2 years of operation far surpassed all prior maps and were comparable to visible-light photographs of other planets. Magellan imaged over 98% of the Venusian surface by radar, and mapped 95% of its gravity field. In 1994, at the end of its mission, Magellan was sent to its destruction into the atmosphere of Venus to quantify its density. Venus was observed by the Galileo and Cassini spacecraft during fly-bys on their respective missions to the outer planets, but Magellan was the last dedicated mission to Venus for over a decade.


=== Recent and current missions ===

On its way to Saturn, Cassini–Huygens made two flybys of Venus for gravity assists, one in 1998 and another in 1999.
NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft made two flybys of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007, to slow its trajectory for an eventual orbital insertion of Mercury in March 2011. It collected scientific data on Venus during both fly-bys.
Venus Express was designed and built by the European Space Agency. Launched on 9 November 2005 by a Russian Soyuz-Fregat rocket procured through Starsem, it successfully assumed a polar orbit around Venus on 11 April 2006. The probe is undertaking a detailed study of the Venusian atmosphere and clouds, including mapping of the planet's plasma environment and surface characteristics, particularly temperatures. One of the first results from Venus Express is the discovery that a huge double atmospheric vortex exists at the southern pole. Venus Express concluded its active mission in December 2014.
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) devised a Venus orbiter, Akatsuki (formerly "Planet-C"), which was launched on 20 May 2010. Planned investigations include surface imaging with an infrared camera and experiments designed to confirm the presence of lightning, as well as the determination of the existence of current surface volcanism. The craft failed to enter orbit in December 2010 due to a malfunction in its main engine. Controllers placed the spacecraft on a trajectory that would return it to Venus in December 2015. Akatsuki successfully entered orbit around Venus on 7 December 2015 using its attitude control thrusters.
In late 2013 the Venus Spectral Rocket Experiment (VeSpR) took place, which launched a sub-orbital space telescope.


=== Planned and proposed missions ===

The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to launch a mission to Mercury in January 2017 called BepiColombo, which will perform two fly-bys of Venus before it reaches Mercury orbit in 2020.
NASA will launch the Solar Probe Plus in 2018, which will perform seven Venus fly-bys during its six-year, 24-orbit reconnaissance of the Sun.
Under its New Frontiers program, NASA has proposed a lander mission called the Venus In-Situ Explorer to land on Venus to study surface conditions and investigate the elemental and mineralogical features of the regolith. The probe would be equipped with a core sampler to drill into the surface and study pristine rock samples not weathered by the harsh surface conditions. A Venus atmospheric and surface probe mission, "Surface and Atmosphere Geochemical Explorer" (SAGE), was proposed by NASA as a candidate mission study in the 2009 New Frontiers selection, but the mission was not selected for flight.
The Venera-D (Russian: Венера-Д) probe is a proposed Russian space probe to Venus, to be launched around 2024, to make remote-sensing observations around the planet and deploying a lander, based on the Venera design, capable of surviving for a long duration on the surface. Other proposed Venus exploration concepts include rovers, balloons, and aeroplanes.
A Venus aircraft called VAMP (Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform) would be an inflatable propeller powered aircraft that might be proposed for the U.S. New Frontiers program.
In 2015 the Russian Space Research Institute said the that the U.S. and Russia were considering a joint mission to Venus in the 2020s.
Two possible future U.S. missions under consideration are DAVINCI and VERITAS as part of the 2015 Discovery Program selection.


=== Manned fly-by concept ===

A manned Venus fly-by mission, using Apollo program hardware, was proposed in the late 1960s. The mission was planned to launch in late October or early November 1973, and would have used a Saturn V to send three men to fly past Venus in a flight lasting approximately one year. The spacecraft would have passed approximately 5,000 km (3,100 mi) from the surface of Venus about four months later.
Venus flybys have also been proposed as part of trajectories designed for manned missions to Mars. The Soviet TMK-Mavr concept was one such proposal, and similar concepts were studied by NASA and its contractors in the 1960s. Inspiration Mars, a private nonprofit which aims to conduct a manned Mars flyby, includes a manned Venus flyby in the 2021 variant of their mission.


=== Sample return ===
Various concepts for a Venus sample return include a high-speed upper atmosphere collection, an atmosphere sample return by slowing down and entering then returning, and a surface sample return.


=== Spacecraft timeline ===
This is a list of attempted and successful spacecraft that have left Earth to explore Venus more closely. Venus has also been imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit, and distant telescopic observations are another source of information about Venus.


== In culture ==
See also Venus (mythology), Venus (astrology) and Historical observations and impact
Throughout history and cultures, the planet has been of remarkable importance as an especial object of observation, reflection and projection. Popular beliefs and observations resulted in different and in parts similar patterns in mythology as well as phenomenological descriptions, attributions and depictions, e.g. in astrology. Such developments in manifestations of human thought reflect the planet's image as a result of early observations of Venus and their impact on culture and science.


=== Etymology ===
The adjective Venusian is commonly used for items related to Venus, though the Latin adjective is the rarely used Venerean; the archaic Cytherean is still occasionally encountered. Venus is the only planet in the Solar System that is named after a female figure. (Three dwarf planets—Ceres, Eris and Haumea—along with many of the first discovered asteroids and some moons (such as the Galilean moons) also have feminine names. Earth and the Moon also have feminine names in many languages—Gaia/Terra, Selene/Luna—but the female mythological figures who personified them were named after them, not the other way around.)


=== Venus symbol ===

The astronomical symbol for Venus is the same as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. The Venus symbol also represents femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.


== Colonization and terraforming ==

Due to its extremely hostile conditions, a surface colony on Venus is not possible with current technology. The atmospheric pressure and temperature approximately fifty kilometres above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface. In Venus's mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, Earth's air (nitrogen and oxygen) would act as a lifting gas. This has led to proposals for "floating cities" in the Venusian atmosphere. Aerostats (lighter-than-air balloons) could be used for initial exploration and ultimately for permanent settlements. Among the many engineering challenges are the dangerous amounts of sulfuric acid at these heights.
