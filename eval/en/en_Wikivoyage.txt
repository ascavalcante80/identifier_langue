ed activity in wiki communities and is expressly permitted by the Creative Commons–Attribution–Share Alike (CC BY-SA) license in use on sites such as Wikitravel. MediaWiki, the wiki software used for Wikitravel, included that facility, although Internet Brands disabled the function shortly after this date in an attempt to prevent the data migration. The community discussion at Wikimedia ended on August 23, 2012 with 540 votes for and 152 votes against the creation of a Wikimedia Foundation travel guide. The project began in beta on WMF servers on November 10, 2012 and was launched fully on January 15, 2013.
As part of the migration, it is planned that current owners and user body "Wikivoyage e.V." will remain in place as an associated organization affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation "at an organizational level". Wikivoyage stated that, freed of the need to maintain its servers, it would be able to benefit by increasing its work related to outreach, community support, discussion and information, and technical enhancements to the site's software.
In September 2012, Internet Brands filed a lawsuit against one Wikitravel administrator, Ryan Holliday, and one Wikipedia administrator, James Heilman, accusing them of trademark breach and commercial misconduct in the proposals affecting that site, with the defendants and Wikimedia rejecting the case as an example of a SLAPP lawsuit—one that is undertaken without plausible legal grounds for the primary purpose of deterring, overwhelming, or frustrating people engaged in fully lawful actions. On November 19, 2012, the claims by Internet Brands were dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California.


=== Evolution ===
English Wikivoyage experiences a constant increase in number of articles (about +1 % per month) and a stable amount of activity (about 300 monthly active users and 800 total monthly editors).
After a peak in visits and activity between January and March 2013, confirmed by an Alexa global rank of about 8000 in March for English Wikivoyage, 2013 Wikivoyage has been between the 20,000 and 30,000 position in the global Alexa rank, considerably worse than Wikitravel's rank which however declined from around 3000th position in 2011 to about 6000th in 2015.
