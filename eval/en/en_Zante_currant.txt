The fresh fruit of zante currants are very small and sweet, with quite intense flavor for a grape. Black Corinth, White Corinth, and Red Corinth is often marketed under the name "Champagne grapes" in U.S. specialty stores, but despite the name, they are not used for making Champagne.
When dried, they are used in cooking, especially baking and are a major ingredient of currant slice (or currant square) and currant cake. In the United Kingdom, they are usually called simply "currants", and often are used in scones, currant buns, Christmas cake, Christmas pudding and mincemeat. They are sometimes sold in mixtures as "mixed dried fruit".
Unlike blackcurrants, Zante currants are not a significant source of vitamin C.
