kground (e.g. the Juno clump). Clans are groupings which merge very gradually into the background density and/or have a complex internal structure making it difficult to decide whether they are one complex group or several unrelated overlapping groups (e.g. the Flora family has been called a clan). Tribes are groups that are less certain to be statistically significant against the background either because of small density or large uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the members.

Notes for table:
[A]: Mean of the "core" members found in HCM and WAM analyses by Zappala et al. (1995), rounded to 2 significant digits. That analysis considered 12487 asteroids, but currently over 300,000 are known (an increase by a factor of over 25). Hence, the number of currently catalogued asteroids that are members of a given family is likely to be greater than the value in this column by a similar factor of roughly 25.
[B]: Reference elsewhere.
[C]: Most of these are families listed as "robustly" identified in Bendjoya and Zappala (2002). Exception: Karin family.
[D]: TNOs are not considered asteroids, but are included here for completeness.
