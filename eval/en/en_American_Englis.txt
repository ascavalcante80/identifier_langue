urvey polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they use for a variety of given definitions. This 2003 study concludes that:
For a "long sandwich that contains cold cuts, lettuce, and so on", the most common term throughout the country (preferred by 77% of the participants) is the word sub (i.e., submarine sandwich). The New York metropolitan area shows the greatest variety of terms for this idea in one single region, largely counting for the 5% of the survey who prefer the term hero, nearly 7% (which is even more prevalent in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, including all of New Jersey as well as eastern Pennsylvania) who prefer hoagie, and just less that 3% (also notably prevalent throughout New England, except Maine) who prefer grinder.
The U.S. is largely divided about the "generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage". Nearly 53% of the surveyed sample say soda, particularly in the Northeast, eastern Wisconsin, Greater St. Louis, the far West, and some of South Florida. Over 25% say pop, particularly around the Midwest (including the Great Lakes region) and the Western regions along the Canadian border. Over 12% say coke (which is also trademarked for a specific cola product), particularly scattered throughout the South. Urban, coastal California speakers use all three terms, though especially soda. Speakers of the West generally use soda or pop.
The most common words "to address a group of two or more people" (in the second person) are the phrase you guys at almost 43%, particularly throughout the Northeast and Great Lakes region (along with simply you at nearly 13%). Y'all is preferred by 14%, particularly in the South, but reaching somewhat into the northern regions as well. Yous(e) is largely confined to the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, at just over half of 1%.
The most common term for generic, rubber-soled shoes worn for athletic activities is sneakers as said by 46% throughout the country, but particularly in the Northeast. 41%, particularly outside of the Northeast, say tennis shoes. Several much rarer other terms may also be used in various regions of the country.
Nearly 68% of American English speakers make no distinction between dinner and supper, or simply never use the term supper.
64% of American speakers say "Where are you at?" to mean "How are you coming along?" This also incorporates the 34% who use "Where are you at?" in any context, for example, to even mean "Where are you physically located right now?"
Small "freshwater lobsters" are known by 40% of polled speakers as crawfish, 32% as crayfish, and 19% as crawdads within no particular regional boundaries (though crayfish seems fairly uncommon in the South).
The most common nicknames for grandparents are grandpa/grampa and grandma/gramma.
Nearly all American English speakers call the lampyrid insect a firefly or lightning bug, with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably.


== Differences between British and American English ==

American English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography. The first large American dictionary, An American Dictionary of the English Language, was written by Noah Webster in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.
Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some verbal auxiliaries; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: learned/learnt, burned/burnt, snuck/sneaked, dove/dived) although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE in school, BrE at school); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE to the hospital, BrE to hospital; contrast, however, AmE actress Elizabeth Taylor, BrE the actress Elizabeth Taylor). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.
Differences in orthography are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as flavor for British flavour, fiber for fibre, defense for defence, analyze for analyse, catalog for catalogue and traveling for travelling. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology". Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of 19th century Victorian England (for example they preferred programme for program, manoeuvre for maneuver, cheque for check, etc.). AmE almost always uses -ize in words like realize. BrE prefers -ise, but also uses -ize (see Oxford spelling).
There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.
AmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE transportation and BrE transport or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE burglarize and BrE burgle (from burglar). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.
