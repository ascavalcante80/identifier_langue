ocal film maker Terry Woolf has run the Dog Island Floating Film Festival. The festival misses some years, but has run a total of 10 times to date. The festival typically runs in the late summer, a flotilla of canoes and other leisure craft watch films projected on the side of a houseboat in Yellowknife Bay.
During the winter, there is the Snowking Winter Festival, featuring a snow castle on Great Slave Lake. The Long John Jamboree, a new winter festival, took place March 23–25, 2012 on the frozen Yellowknife Bay next to the Snowking castle, in Yellowknife's Old Town neighbourhood. Events include an ice sculpture contest sponsored by De Beers Canada, cultural events like Dene hand games, games, live music, a beer garden, food vendors, skating rink, artist's market, and much more. The Caribou Carnival, once held annually on Frame Lake, has not been held in recent years. Yellowknife hosted the inaugural Arctic Winter Games in 1970, and has since hosted athletes and artists from circumpolar regions at the biennial multi-sport and multi-cultural event in 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2008.
In 2007 The White Stripes played in Yellowknife for their tour of Canada. The entire tour was recorded for a documentary called Under Great White Northern Lights.


=== Attractions ===

Some notable places to visit in Yellowknife include:
The Wildcat Cafe, which first opened in 1937. The popular restaurant still operates in its original building during the summer, which was moved to its current location after being saved from demolition in the late 1970s. The Wildcat Cafe has been renovated from 2011 to 2013, and during these times there were a few ups and downs to get the place ready for open. The City hosted a grand opening of the new Wildcat Cafe on June 16, 2013.
The Gold Range Bar, (also known as The Strange Range and listed in the circa 1989 phonebook as such) one of the oldest and most colorful drinking establishments in the Northwest Territories and featured in Elizabeth Hay's novel "Late Nights On Air" and Mordecai Richler's novel Solomon Gursky Was Here.
