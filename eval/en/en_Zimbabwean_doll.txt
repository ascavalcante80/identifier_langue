 repair parts were no longer being shipped to Zimbabwe to repair the machines. The Reserve Bank issued the $100 billion Agro Cheque on 21 July, which were printed prior to the suspension.
On 30 July 2008 the RBZ announced a new currency, effective 1 August 2008, removing 10 zeros from the monetary value, by "a factor of 1 to 10". Banknotes in the denominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $100 and $500 were introduced and replaced bearer cheques and agro cheques by 31 December 2008. However, the familiar cycle of printing ever higher denomination notes to keep up with inflation continued despite redenomination. A $1,000 banknote was introduced by the RBZ on 19 September 2008, and ten days later, as the unofficial exchange rate surpassed 270,000 ZWD to the US dollar, it issued new notes in the denominations of $10,000 and $20,000. A $50,000 banknote was released on 13 October 2008, followed by $100,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000 denominations announced on 3 November. The daily cash withdrawal limit was raised for individuals to Z$500,000 from Z$50,000 and for select companies it went up to $1 million. Banknotes valued at $10 million, $50 million and $100 million were issued as the withdrawal limit was increased to $100 million per week on 4 December 2008. Scarcely four days later, on 8 December, the RBZ issued a $200 million banknote, and introduced a $500 million note on 12 December, worth approximately US$8 at the time. In little over half a year, the billion denomination returned, with the RBZ issuing banknotes of $1 billion, $5 billion, and $10 billion on 19 December.
Amid the continuing hyperinflation that rendered the currency virtually worthless, spurring the increasing dollarisation of the economy, the RBZ issued another set of new notes in denominations of $20 billion and $50 billion to be released 12 January. Stepping up another order of magnitude, the Reserve Bank introduced trillion-denominated notes for the first time, unveiling banknotes valued at $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion, and $100 trillion on 16 January, which were supposed to help citizens still in formal employment to withdraw a full month's worth of salary by showing a corresponding payslip. As even these notes became increasingly worthless, a media campaign was launched in South Africa using the notes as printing paper.
On 2 February 2009 the dollar was revalued once more, this time in the ratio of 1:1012, and new banknotes of the fourth dollar, with seven denominations from $1 to $500, were issued. These banknotes circulated alongside the third dollar until the abandonment of the dollar on 12 April 2009.


== Exchange rate historyEdit ==
This table shows a condensed history of the foreign exchange rate of the Zimbabwean Dollars to one US Dollar:
† Due to the December 2007 banknote shortage, funds transferred via Electronic Funds Transfer Systems (EFTS) bore a premium rate of about $4 million, while the cash transaction rate varied around $2 million.
‡ Exchange rate was 20,000,000 for large amounts.
The third dollar rates above are OMIR. The cash rate differs significantly to the above rates. The table below is the cash rate of the third dollar history:


=== Devaluation of the first dollarEdit ===
The first dollar devalued from 0.6788 R$ to 1 US$ in 1978 to roughly half a million per US$ in 2006, when the currency is revalued.
This table shows in more detail the historical value of one U.S. dollar in Zimbabwean dollars:


=== Devaluation of the second dollarEdit ===
The second dollar started off on 1 August 2006 with an official rate of 250 and a parallel rate of 550 to the US$. In July 2008 the dollar was revalued again, this time 10,000,000,000 2nd dollars became 1 3rd dollar, after the parallel rate reached 500 billion to 1 US$.

==== Restoration of market data feedsEdit ====
In the final months before Zimbabwe's central bank reforms of 30 April 2008, virtually all popular currency conversion resources relied upon the official rate of 30,000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures, in spite of the vast differences between that and free market rates. By 23 May 2008, Bloomberg and Oanda began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe's formally regulated domestic bank market, while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July, albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places. Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table. They soon began to differ, in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, increasingly substantially in comparison to less regulated markets such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare, reflected above as Parallel Rates.


=== Devaluation of the third dollarEdit ===
On 1 August 2008, ten zeroes were removed from the currency, reducing 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars to one dollar. On 3 October 2008, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe suspended temporarily the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, halting electronic parallel market transfers, but it was reinstated on 13 November 2008.
After being introduced on 1 August 2008, the third dollar continued to devalue.
An overview of the exchange rate data can be found in the table below :


=== Devaluation of the fourth dollarEdit ===
On 2 February 2009 the RBZ removed 12 zeros from the currency, with 1,000,000,000,000 (third) Zimbabwe dollars being exchanged for 1 new (fourth) dollar. Although the dollar was abandoned on 12 April 2009, exchange rates were maintained at intervals for some months. So, the fourth dollar would be worth 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 2 x 10^35 first dollars if never revalued.
On 4 June 2015 it was announced that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe would exchange some of the old banknotes for US dollars.
