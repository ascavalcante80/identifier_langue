with any aircraft that is cleared to carry unguided Zunis in a 4-place LAU-10 Launcher, including AV-8B Harriers, F/A-18 Hornets, AH-1 Cobra Helicopters and P-3 Orion aircraft. The precision weapon fits in the same launcher as unguided Zunis and requires only a 28V firing pulse and a semi active laser designator. The weapon was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Weapons Division of the U.S. Navy's Air Warfare Center in China Lake, California (NAWC WD).
In 2009, the Laser Guided Zuni Rocket was successfully tested against both a stationary and moving targets. The weapon successfully underwent a live fire warhead test flight in September 2010.
