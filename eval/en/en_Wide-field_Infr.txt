ing the remaining post-cryogenic detection capability (two of four detectors on WISE work without cryogen). In February 2011, NASA announced that NEOWISE had discovered many new objects in the Solar System, including twenty comets. During its primary and extended missions, the spacecraft delivered characterizations of 158,000 minor planets, including more than 35,000 newly discovered objects. The spacecraft was put into hibernation on February 1, 2011. In September 2013, it was reactivated and assigned to assist NASA's efforts to identify the population of potentially hazardous near-Earth objects. Few objects smaller than 100 meters in diameter were detected by NEOWISE's automated detection software known as WISE Moving Object Processing Software (WMOPS). The software requires five or more detections. The average albedo of asteroids larger than 100 meters discovered by NEOWISE is 0.14.
As of November 2015, WISE/NEOWISE statistics lists a total of 218 near-Earth objects (NEOs) discovered by the spacecraft:
196 NEAs (subset of NEOs)
037 PHAs (subset of NEAs)
022 comets
Of the 196 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), 37 of them are considered potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), a subset of the much larger family of NEOs, but particularly more likely to hit Earth and cause significant destruction. NEOs can be divided into NECs (comets only) and NEAs (asteroids only), and further into subcategories such as Atira or Apohele asteroids, Aten asteroids, Apollo asteroids, Amor asteroids and the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs).


=== Data releases ===
On April 14, 2011, a preliminary release of WISE data was made public, covering 57 percent of the sky observed by the spacecraft. On March 14, 2012, a new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky as imaged by WISE was released to the astronomic community. On July 31, 2012 NEOWISE Post-Cryo Preliminary Data was released. A release called AllWISE, combining all data, was approved.


=== Recommissioning ===
On August 21, 2013, NASA announced it would recommission WISE with a new mission to search for asteroids with orbits that could potentially lead to a collision with Earth. Additionally, it will search for asteroids that a robotic spacecraft could potentially intercept and redirect to orbit the Moon. The new mission began in September and is scheduled to last three years. With all coolant long used up, NASA brought the temperature of the craft down from its previous 200 K to the necessary 75 K by having the telescope stare into deep space for a while. This caused most of the built up heat to radiate away. The spacecraft's instruments were then re-calibrated and the new mission commenced.
NASA said it hopes to discover 150 previously unknown target asteroids, known as near-Earth objects. The agency hopes to also learn more about the size and shape of 2,000 known asteroids. It will cost an estimated $5 million per year. The new mission was due in part to calls for NASA to step up asteroid detection after the previously undetected Chelyabinsk meteor exploded over Russia in February 2013.
