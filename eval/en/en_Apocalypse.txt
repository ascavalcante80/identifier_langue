ks in part to the Left Behind series of books and films. Dispensationalists find in Biblical prophecy predictions of future events: periods of the Church, for example, shown through the letters to the seven churches in the Revelation of John; the throne of God in heaven and his glory; specific judgments that will occur on the earth; the final form of Gentile power; God' re-dealing with Israel based upon covenants mentioned in the Hebrew Old Testament; the second coming proper; a one-thousand year reign of Messiah; a last test of mankind's sinful nature under ideal conditions by the loosing of Satan, with a judgment of fire coming down from Heaven that follows; the Great White Throne judgment, and the re-creation of the current heavens and the earth as a "New Heaven and New Earth" ushering in the beginning of Eternity. A differing interpretation is found in the Post Tribulation Rapture.
One of the most extensive works covering the symbolic meanings in the Book of Revelation was written by Emanuel Swedenborg called the Apocalypse Revealed, first published in two volumes in Amsterdam in 1766, a condensed version of his unpublished work Apocalypse Explained. Unlike literal interpretations which seek to interpret the Book of Revelation in terms of historical events or some future visible event, the "end of the age" is described as the end of the old Christian Protestant and Catholic churches, to be superseded in a new age by the establishment of the New Church, symbolized by the New Jerusalem descending from heaven.
