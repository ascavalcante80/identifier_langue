== PhylogenyEdit ==
The phylogeny of Rosids shown below is adapted from Wang and co-authors (2009), with order names from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Branches with less than 50% bootstrapping support are collapsed. Other branches have 100% bootstrap support except where shown..This phylogenetic tree has been changed following the publication of Fragaria vesca and Eucalyptus grandis genome papers. Malpighiales has been moved out of Fabidae, but the exact position in Malvidae is still unknown.
The nitrogen-fixing clade contains a high number of actinorhizal plants (which have root nodules containing nitrogen fixing bacteria, helping the plant grow in poor soils). Not all plants in this clade are actinorhizal, however.
