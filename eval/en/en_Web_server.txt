walls to block unwanted traffic coming from bad IP sources or having bad patterns
HTTP traffic managers to drop, redirect or rewrite requests having bad HTTP patterns
Bandwidth management and traffic shaping, in order to smooth down peaks in network usage

Deploying web cache techniques
Using different domain names to serve different (static and dynamic) content by separate web servers, i.e.:
http://images.example.com
http://www.example.com

Using different domain names and/or computers to separate big files from small and medium-sized files; the idea is to be able to fully cache small and medium-sized files and to efficiently serve big or huge (over 10 - 1000 MB) files by using different settings
Using many internet servers (programs) per computer, each one bound to its own network card and IP address
Using many internet servers (computers) that are grouped together behind a load balancer so that they act or are seen as one big web server
Adding more hardware resources (i.e. RAM, disks) to each computer
Tuning OS parameters for hardware capabilities and usage
Using more efficient computer programs for web servers, etc.
Using other workarounds, especially if dynamic content is involved
