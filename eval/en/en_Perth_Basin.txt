 Basin contains Permian and Jurassic coal measures, the most important being mined primarily for electricity generation in the Collie Sub-basin at Collie in the south-west of the state.
The Perth Basin is also prospective for natural gas and oil, with recent exploration wells, including Origin Energy/Arc Energy's Hovea 2, confirming large resources of natural gas, but difficult reservoir geology and characteristics have prevented the full utilisation of these energy reserves. The oil is sourced from the Kockatea Shale.
Currently, a junior minerals exploration company is exploring the basin north of Perth for glauconite to produce potash fertilizer.


== Regions ==
Due to its shape and size, the basin has been surveyed and studied in distinctions such as offshore and onshore, north and south.
