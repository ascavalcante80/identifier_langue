10 TK7 is not an energetically attractive target for a space mission because of its orbital inclination: It moves so far above and below Earth's orbit that the required change in velocity for a spacecraft to match its trajectory coming from Earth's would be 9.4 km/s, whereas some other near-Earth asteroids require less than 4 km/s.
During the 5 December 2012 Earth close approach of 0.197 AU (29,500,000 km; 18,300,000 mi), the asteroid only had an apparent magnitude of about 21.
