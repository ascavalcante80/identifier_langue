uction".
According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is aja, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal as it is transitory), and not absolutely existent. Thus, Gaudapada's concept of ajativada is similar to Buddhist term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin or śūnyatā.
But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the Mandukya Upanishad. In the Mandukya Karika, Gaudapada's commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad, Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, the metaphysical absolute called Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (paramārthatā) the phenomenal world is māyā, "illusion", apparently existing but ultimately not real.
In Gaudapada-Karika, chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that Brahman never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:

When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into Brahman. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.

In contrast to Renard's view, Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has nothing in common with the Śūnyatā concept in Buddhism. While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, Atman or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.


=== In ShaivismEdit ===
In Veerashaivism, Shunya or Shoonya (empty, zero, void) is seen as the nature of the Supreme Consciousness or Shiva. Shunya is represented as a point, or Bindu, which is beyond one and many, and beyond human intellect. Another similar term which is used in Veerashaivism to describe Shiva is balayu – void or nothingness. One of the most important texts in South Indian Veerashaivism is called the Shunyasampadane, which means the "earning of voidness", signifying the spiritual path of merging with Shiva. H.H. Mahatapasvi Shri Kumarswamiji explains Shiva thus:

It [Shiva] is the transcendent Reality, the pure Absolute, the supracosmic Infinity. It is itself its own world, its own universe, of any other than itself it can form no concept. It knows not length nor breadth nor height, for it has no experience of them; it has no cognisance even of the number one, for it is itself one and all being is really nothing. How to represent it? Words come out baffled, it defies all definition and description. Yet the humble attempt of human mind to represent it ends in a zero. So it is represented by a zero or Shunya.

The philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism also incorporated and modified the concept of Shunya from Buddhism into their theory of nondual monism. The Shaivites of Kashmir defined Shunya as 'shunyam ashunaym iti ukhtam' ('shunya is said to be ashunya'). This view does not see Shunya as a total void or completely empty. The Shaivites see Shunya as 'abhava', meaning that beings (bhavas) lie in a condition of absolute mergence (in Shiva's supreme consciousness). It sees zero or voidness as always having the potential for multiplicity already present.
References to experiences of Shunya can be seen in the poems of the Shaivaite poet Lalleshwari.


=== In other Hindu sectsEdit ===
The influence of the Shunya theory on Orissan Vaishnavism may be derived from the missionary work of Nagarjuna, who visited the kingdom and converted King Muñja to Buddhism and set up various monasteries in the region. The philosophy of Shunya was also preached by various tantric teachers in the seventh century CE and was called the "Nagantaka" philosophy.  In the Vaishnavism of Orissa, the idea of Shunya Brahman or Shunya Purusha was widespread in the poetry of the Orissan Panchasakhas (Five Friends) like the 16th-century Acyutananda. Acyutananda's magnum opus, the Shunya Samhita, extols the nature of Shunya Brahman:

nāhi tāhāra rūpa varṇa, adṛsha avarṇa tā cinha.tāhāku brahmā boli kahi, śūnya brahmhati se bolāi.
It has no shape, no colour,
It is invisible and without a name
This Brahman is called Shunya Brahman.

The Panchasakhas practiced a form of Bhakti called Jnana-mishrita Bhakti-marga, which saw the necessity of knowledge (Jnana) and devotion - Bhakti.
The poetry of Bhima Bhoi, founder of the Satya Mahima Dharma tradition, also promotes God as Shunya. Mahima Swami of the Mahima Dharma is another example of a Hindu thinker who saw the nature of God as being formless (Alekh).
In medieval Bengal, the concept of God as being Shunya, void or formless, was also popular. The eleventh century medieval Bengali poet Ramai Pandit wrote a text called the Shunya Purana which describes God as "Dharma" and "Shunya".
