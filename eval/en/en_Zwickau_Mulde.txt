Annual demonstration timber rafting on the Muldenberg rafting waterway system
Above Zwickau, in Cainsdorf, the Mulde cuts the Rußkohlenflöz. This outcrop of a permanently exposed coal seam is unique in Saxony. It is also a rare example in Europe of an outcrop representing three geological time periods (the Silurian, the Devonian and the Upper Carboniferous). It is protected as a geotope and geological natural monument.
