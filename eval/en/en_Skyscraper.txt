have more than 100 floors (it has 102), was completed the following year. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the contemporary Art Deco style. The tower takes its name from the nickname of New York State. Upon its completion in 1931 at 1,250 feet (381 m), it took the top spot as tallest building, and towered above all other buildings until 1972. The antenna mast added in 1951 brought pinnacle height to 1,472 feet (449 m), lowered in 1984 to 1,454 feet (443 m).
The World Trade Center officially reached full height in 1972, was completed in 1973, and consisted of two tall towers and several smaller buildings. For a short time, the first of the two towers was the world's tallest building. Upon completion, the towers stood for 28 years, until the September 11 attacks destroyed the buildings in 2001. Various governmental entities, financial firms, and law firms called the towers home.
The Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was completed in 1974, one year after the World Trade Center, and surpassed it as the world's tallest building. It was the first building to employ the "bundled tube" structural system, designed by Fazlur Khan. The building was not surpassed in height until the Petronas Towers were constructed in 1998, but remained the tallest in some categories until Burj Khalifa surpassed it in all categories in 2010. It is currently the second tallest building in the United States, after One World Trade Center, which was built to replace the destroyed towers.
Momentum in setting records passed from the United States to other nations with the opening of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1998. The record for the world's tallest building has remained in Asia since the opening of Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, in 2004. A number of architectural records, including those of the world's tallest building and tallest free-standing structure, moved to the Middle East with the opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
This geographical transition is accompanied by a change in approach to skyscraper design. For much of the twentieth century large buildings took the form of simple geometrical shapes. This reflected the "international style" or modernist philosophy shaped by Bauhaus architects early in the century. The last of these, the Willis Tower and World Trade Center towers in New York, erected in the 1970s, reflect the philosophy. Tastes shifted in the decade which followed, and new skyscrapers began to exhibit postmodernist influences. This approach to design avails itself of historical elements, often adapted and re-interpreted, in creating technologically modern structures. The Petronas Twin Towers recall Asian pagoda architecture and Islamic geometric principles. Taipei 101 likewise reflects the pagoda tradition as it incorporates ancient motifs such as the ruyi symbol. The Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from traditional Islamic art. Architects in recent years have sought to create structures that would not appear equally at home if set in any part of the world, but that reflect the culture thriving in the spot where they stand.
The following list measures height of the roof. The more common gauge is the "highest architectural detail"; such ranking would have included Petronas Towers, built in 1998.

== Cancellation ==
Many skyscrapers were never built due to financial problems, politics and culture. The Chicago Spire was to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, but it was on hold due to the global financial crisis of 2008. One year later, the project was cancelled.
The 610-metre (2,000 ft) Russia Tower was cancelled due to the global financial crisis of 2008. It would have dominated the Moscow skyline.
Proposed in 1989, The Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle would have been the tallest freestanding in the world. But it was never built due to the Persian gulf war.
The cancelled Chicago World Trade Center would have been the first skyscraper to exceed a height of 700 metres (2,300 ft). It was proposed in the 1990s, a second one was to be completed but never built.
The construction of the 200-floor, Nakheel Tower—which was planned to be taller than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft)—was halted due to financial problems; 18 months later the project was cancelled.
Harry Grants Grant USA Tower was never built due to bankruptcy, the tower would have more than 550 meters tall.
Project 2000 Tower was cancelled and never built, it would have had a height of 610 metres (2,000 ft)
The proposed 1 New York Place would have had a height of 320 metres (1,050 ft), but was never built.
Brisbane's Vision Brisbane was to be replaced by a new building, Brisbane's tallest, but it was scrapped.
The original design of Hong Kong's International Commerce Centre, with a height of 574 metres (1,883 ft), was supposed to have a crystal facade. It was changed and decreased to 484 metres (1,588 ft)s due to height restrictions.


== Future developments ==

At the time Taipei 101 broke the half-km mark in height, it was already technically possible to build structures towering over a km above the ground. Proposals for such structures have been put forward, including the Burj Mubarak Al Kabir in Kuwait and Azerbaijan Tower in Baku. Kilometer-plus structures present architectural challenges that may eventually place them in a new architectural category.
The following skyscrapers, all contenders for being among the tallest in their city or region, are under construction and due to be completed in the next few years:
Jeddah Tower is currently under construction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It will have more than 160 floors and will become the worlds tallest building, and is to be the first building to have a height of more than one kilometer.
Construction of the 115-floor, 600 meter tall Ping'an International Finance Center started in Shenzhen, China, 2010. It will be China's second tallest building and the fourth-tallest building in the world. The antenna was removed due the possibility it can obstruct flight paths.
Construction of the 124-floor, 636 meter tall Wuhan Greenland Center started in late 2012 in Wuhan, China. It will be the second-tallest building in the world and the tallest structure in Hubei province and in China.
The Proposed Dubai One Tower will become the 3rd tallest building in the world, by 711 meters, Surpassing the 638 meter, Signature Tower Jakarta.
Construction of the 125-floor, 625 m tall Rama IX Super Tower started in Bangkok, Thailand in 2014. It is set to become the tallest building in South East Asia.
Construction of the 123-floor, 555 m tall Lotte World Premium Tower started in Seoul, South Korea in 2012. t is set to become the tallest building in the OECD, with the tallest observation deck in the world.
Construction of the 110-floor, 510 m tall Busan Lotte World, Busan, South Korea, started in 2009. It was to be for completion in 2016.
The 86-floor, 463 m tall Lakhta Center in Saint Peterburg, Russia is set to become Europe's tallest building when completed in 2018.
Construction of the 102-floor, 487 m tall 151 Incheon Tower in Songdo International City, Incheon, South Korea, started in 2008, which is scheduled to be the tallest twin towers in the world when it is completed.
World One is a 442 m (1,450 ft) tall residential skyscraper under construction in Mumbai, India. It is located in Upper Worli of Mumbai on a 17.5 acre site. The project will cost INR 2,000 crore (US$380 million), will be completed by 2016 and will have the world’s second tallest residential tower once completed. It will be rated as Leed Gold Certified building by the Green Building Council. World One is designed by Pei Cobb Freed and Partners and Leslie E. Robertson Associates.
Millennium Tower in Frankfurt, Germany is set to become the tallest skyscraper of the European Union, at a height of 369 m (1,211 ft) with 97 stories. One third of the tower is supposed to be residential.
