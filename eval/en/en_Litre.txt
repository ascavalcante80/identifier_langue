anada, Australia and New Zealand, consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used. Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1 kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.
Although kilolitres, megalitres and gigalitres are commonly used for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, for larger volumes of fluids, such as annual consumption of tap water, lorry (truck) tanks, or swimming pools, the cubic metre is the general unit. It is also generally for all volumes of a non-liquid nature.


== Usages to indicate capacity ==
Fields where the litre and millilitre are used as a measurement for non-liquid volumes, where the capacity of the container is indicated, include:
Solid items that can be poured and are measured by their containers (such as, in many places, berries)
Car boot/trunk size 
Rucksacks & Climbing packs 
Computer cases 
Microwave ovens
Refrigerators 
Bins
Engine displacement
