 General Odría modified the national flag to its current form, removing the coat of arms from the civil flag, since it was used de facto, being easier to make. The national ensign and war flag were created for exclusive uses, each with a variant of the coat of arms, which was also changed slightly. These remain as the official flags today.


== Similar flagsEdit ==
With some variation in the particular shade of red and the size proportions of the vertical bands, the design of the flag of Canada, adopted in 1965, is similar to that of Peru. The main difference between both flags, aside from the length of the bands, are the symbols which for Canada is the traditional maple leaf. Other similar flags include those whose colors are horizontal, such as the Austrian triband.


== The Marcha de BanderasEdit ==
The Marcha de Banderas (Spanish: March of Flags) is a military march sung during the flag raising. It was created in 1897 by SM Jose Salas Libornio who said President Nicolás de Piérola, he disagreed with the indiscriminate interpretation of the National Anthem at all official events that were derived from civic events. In December of that year was officially recognized to be executed in any official act.
In all occasions today only 3 out of 4 verses of this flag anthem are sung instead.
