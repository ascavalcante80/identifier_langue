 prevented from carrying out skilled or well-paid labour. White workers were provided with subsidized housing, extensive job training, and opportunities for occupational advancement. Black labourers were given free basic accommodation in hostels so that they could be close to their workplace; however these were extremely cramped, dirty and sometimes crime-ridden. The hostels were not open to families and only males were allowed. This became a political issue during the struggle for a democratic South Africa.
After a series of strikes in the 1930s and 1940s, the company provided white workers with cheap housing, generous pensions and health insurance. After forty years of work, skilled workers were eligible for a 100% pension, including annual adjustments for inflation. Black workers were not eligible for pensions until the 1980s. Blacks never received inflation-adjusted pensions as the company eliminated the pension scheme after it was privatized of the company in 1989.


== OperationsEdit ==
Iscor has become a primary iron and steel producer, with works at Pretoria, Vanderbijlpark, Newcastle, Durban, Vereeniging and Kuils River. Iscor's mining business has been unbundled into a resource focused company, Kumba Resources.
Iscor is closing or mothballing the Pretoria steelworks and linked Corex plant. Shutting the 480,000 t/year steel slabs arc furnace operation in Pretoria will lead to about 1000 payoffs at a cost of about R70m in severance packages. The 360,000 t/year Corex plant could carry on if pig iron exports prove feasible.
