== Morphology of the root -ZuluEdit ==
The root word Zulu can be combined with a number of prefixes to create other words. Here is a table showing a number of words constructed from the roots – Zulu and ntu (the root for person/s; people).
Some prefer to call Zulu isiZulu in English as per the Zulu name for the language.


== Zulu words in South African EnglishEdit ==
South African English has absorbed many words from the Zulu language. Others, such as the names of local animals (impala and mamba are both Zulu names) have made their way into standard English. A few examples of Zulu words used in South African English:
muti (from umuthi) – medicine
donga (from udonga) – ditch (udonga actually means 'wall' in Zulu)
indaba – conference (it means 'an item of news' in Zulu)
induna – chief or leader
shongololo (from ishongololo) – millipede
ubuntu – compassion/humanity.
