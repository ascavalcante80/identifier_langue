hern portion of the state.


== Government and politics ==


=== Government ===
The Constitution of Yucatán provides that the government of Yucatán, like the government of every other state in Mexico, consists of three powers: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary.
Executive power rests in the governor of Yucatán, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. Legislative power rests in the Congress of Yucatán which is a unicameral legislature composed of 25 deputies. Judicial power is invested in the Superior Court of Justice of Yucatán.


=== Municipalities ===

The State of Yucatán is divided into 106 municipalities, each headed by a municipal president (mayor). Usually municipalities are named after the city that serves as municipal seat; e.g. the municipal seat of the Municipality of Mérida is the City of Mérida.


=== Politics ===
The most recent local election in Yucatán was held on June 7, 2015.


== Demography ==


=== Major cities and towns ===


=== Languages ===
The most widespread indigenous language of Yucatán is Yucatec Maya, spoken natively by approximately 800,000 people in Yucatán and adjacent Quintana Roo and Campeche, especially in rural areas. The Spanish spoken in Yucatán has lexical and some phonological borrowing from Mayan and employs many words of Mayan origin, such as purux ("fat"), tuch ("navel") and wixar ("urinate").


=== Korean descendants ===
Some estimates place the number of descendants of the original henequen workers to be about thirty thousand. The majority of this population is of mixed ancestry, frequently with the native Maya population. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey.


== Food ==
Yucatecan food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people would consider Mexican food. It includes influences from the local Mayan culture, as well as Caribbean, European (Spanish), (North) African, and Middle Eastern cultures, as well as influence from the cuisine of other parts of Mexico.
There are many regional dishes. Some of them are:
Poc Chuc, a Mayan/Yucatecan version of barbecued pork.
Salbutes and Panuchos. Salbutes are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey, and avocado on top. Panuchos feature fried tortillas filled with black beans and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or puréed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.
Queso relleno is a "gourmet" dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved Edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce and gravy.
Pavo en Relleno Negro is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the mole de guajalote found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in panuchos or salbutes and is usually referred to as "Relleno negro".
Sopa de Lima A turkey, lime, and tortilla soup.
Papadzules. Egg tacos covered in pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.
Cochinita Pibil is a marinated pork dish and by far the most renowned of Yucatecan food.
Xcatik, a type of chili.
Pavo en Relleno Blanco (or simply "Relleno Blanco") is a turkey stew almost like Pavo en Relleno Negro.
Xnipec, a fiery hot salsa or relish similar to pico de gallo, made with habanero chiles and Seville orange juice


== Public Safety ==

The Yucatán State Police is the law enforcement agency inside the state. The security in the interior of the state has been praised in multiple times by the president Felipe Calderón Hinojosa., local and foreign businessman, also by governor Ivonne Ortega Pacheco.
