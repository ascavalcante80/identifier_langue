ial stress, changing the shape of the grains without internal deformation. The dissolved material can travel down a stress-induced chemical gradient to nearby sites of low solubility, called solution transfer, where the redeposition of the material can occur along free grain boundaries that are in contact with the fluid; newly precipitated material may be of a different mineral composition or phase than the dissolved material, known as incongruent pressure solution. Dissolved material may also flow over a large distance and deposit in sites such as veins or strain shadows, or migrate out of the deforming rock volume.
Pressure solution is dominant at diagenetic to low-grade metamorphic conditions, where there are abundant fluids and the high-temperature deformation mechanisms are hindered.


=== Grain-boundary sliding ===

This mechanism is grain-size sensitive and works to change the shapes of the grains so that they can slide past each other without friction and without creating significant voids. This mechanism, acting with diffusive mass transfer has been linked with the development of superplasticity.
Grain-boundary sliding occurs at the highest temperature conditions and strain is produced by neighbor switching. This can result in very large strains without any appreciable internal deformation of the grains, except at the grain boundaries to accommodate the grain sliding; this processes is called superplastic deformation.
Grain-boundary sliding is grain-size dependent and favors small grain sizes, since diffusion pathways are relatively short, and secondary mineral phases may enhance the process since they hamper grain growth.
