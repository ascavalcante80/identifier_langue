 parallax measurements did lead to a distance value of around 450pc, but the revised Hipparchos reduction gave a much lower distance near 333pc. A recent dynamical study points to Zeta Puppis originating in the Trumpler 10 OB association at around 300pc, but this is also a much older cluster and physical models still lead to a distance of 450-600pc.
Zeta Puppis shows a high space velocity and very high rotation rate, and it has been speculated that it is a runaway star resulting from a supernova in a binary system, possibly the progenitor of the Gum Nebula but evidence supporting this is sparse.


== HeliumEdit ==
In 1896, Edward C. Pickering observed mysterious spectral lines from Î¶ Puppis, which fit the Rydberg formula if half-integers were used instead of whole integers. It was later found that these were due to ionized helium.


== NamesakesEdit ==
USS Naos (AK-105) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.
