r than 6 because the letter digamma (also called 'stigma' as a Greek numeral) was originally in the sixth position in the alphabet.


=== Mathematics and science ===
The lower case letter can be used to represent:
The Riemann zeta function in mathematics
The damping ratio of an oscillating system in engineering and physics
The effective nuclear charge on an electron in quantum chemistry
The electrokinetic potential in colloidal systems
The lag angle in helicopter blade dynamics
Relative vorticity in the atmosphere and ocean
A number whose discrete values (eigenvalues) are the positive roots of transcendental equations, used in the series solutions for transient one-dimensional conduction equations.
The heat flux across or through a plane (Industrial Materials Technology).
The Weierstrass zeta-function
In physical chemistry equilibrium computations, lower case Zeta (ʒ) is used to refer to the extent of reaction.


=== Meteorology ===
The name Zeta was a name used in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season as the record-breaking Tropical Storm Zeta.
