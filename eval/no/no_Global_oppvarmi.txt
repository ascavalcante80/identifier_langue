Rather, I see a reliance on climate models (useful but never "proof") and the coincidence that changes in carbon dioxide and global temperatures have loose similarity over time."
^ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/climate_change/1023334.stm "This small warming is likely a result of the natural alterations in global ocean currents which are driven by ocean salinity variations. Ocean circulation variations are as yet little understood. Human kind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes. We are not that influential."[8] "I am of the opinion that [global warming] is one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the American people."
^ http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen/OpEds/LindzenWSJ.pdf "We are quite confident (1) that global mean temperature is about 0.5 °C higher than it was a century ago; (2) that atmospheric levels of CO2 have risen over the past two centuries; and (3) that CO2 is a greenhouse gas whose increase is likely to warm the earth (one of many, the most important being water vapor and clouds). But – and I cannot stress this enough – we are not in a position to confidently attribute past climate change to CO2 or to forecast what the climate will be in the future."
^ Wall Street Journal, 26. juni 2006. "[T]here has been no question whatsoever that CO2 is an infrared absorber (i.e., a greenhouse gas – albeit a minor one), and its increase should theoretically contribute to warming. Indeed, if all else were kept equal, the increase in CO2 should have led to somewhat more warming than has been observed."

Whether the increase will be large enough to be noticeable is still an unanswered question."
^ http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/harris061206.htm "There is no meaningful correlation between CO2 levels and Earth's temperature over this [geologic] time frame. In fact, when CO2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now, about 450 million years ago, the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years. On the basis of this evidence, how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in CO2 levels would be the major cause of the past century's modest warming?"

^ http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0422/p08s01-coop.html "The greenhouse effect is real. However, the effect is minute, insignificant, and very difficult to detect."
