Thin Lizzys/Metallicas versjon:
As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains.
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting.
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier.
I said: "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya".
Yeah
Musha ring dum-a do dum-a da, Whack for my daddy-o,
Whack for my daddy-o, There's whiskey in the jar-o.
