Licenses to participate in the league can be bought and sold on the free market. In August 2002, the PSL bought two Premier Division licences, from the owners of Ria Stars F.C. and Free State Stars F.C., the PSL dissolved the license to ease fixture congestion and reduce their own costs by 400k ZAR per month as each top tier club received 200k ZAR on a monthly basis from the PSL. The two clubs were purchased for 8 million ZAR. The two clubs had differing fates, Ria Stars never appeared again whilst Free State Stars bought the league license from Maholosiane F.C., a team participating in the National First Division in the 2002/2003 season and earned promotion to the top tier in the 2003/2004 season.
