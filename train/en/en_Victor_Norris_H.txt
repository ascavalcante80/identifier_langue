Victor Norris Hamilton (born c. 1919), an American cryptologist, defected to the Soviet Union in 1963. He was rediscovered in a mental hospital in Russia in 1992, where he had been for 20 years.


== Early lifeEdit ==
Hamilton was born in Jaffa in around 1919. He graduated from American University of Beirut, and married Lilly Bell Drake, an American, in Libya, who persuaded him to go to the United States. By his own account, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and was licensed as a teacher in Georgia but was denied work because he was an Arab. He worked as a doorman, until a colonel recruited him to work for the National Security Agency (NSA).
Hamilton secured employment with the NSA in 1957, and worked there for two years in the "A.L.L.O." (all other countries) unit, assigned to study and break coded communications of Middle Eastern governments, including (but not limited to) those involving the Soviet Union. He suffered a nervous breakdown in February 1959, but was kept on at the NSA as it had few employees competent in Arabic. He was discharged in June 1959 for mental health reasons. He later claimed that he faked the symptoms so he could be allowed to leave the agency.
