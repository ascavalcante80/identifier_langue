2003 YN107, also written 2003 YN107, is a very small near-Earth object moving in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth. As such it is co-orbital to Earth.


== Discovery, orbit and physical properties ==
It was discovered by the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) system in orbit around the Sun on December 20, 2003. Its diameter is approximately 10 to 30 metres. 2003 YN107 is on NASA's Earth Close Approach list, and is estimated to miss Earth by 0.01 AU. It revolves around the Sun on an Earth-like, almost circular, orbit. Its orbital period of 363.846 days also is very close to the sidereal year.


== Co-orbital with Earth and orbital evolution ==
From approximately 1997 to 2006, the asteroid remained within 0.1 AU (15,000,000 km; 9,300,000 mi)) of Earth and it appeared to slowly orbit Earth. However, 2003 YN107 is no second moon, as it is not bound to Earth. It is the first discovered member of a postulated group of coorbital objects, or quasi-satellites, which show these path characteristics. Other members of this group include 10563 Izhdubar, 54509 YORP, (66063) 1998 RO1, (85770) 1998 UP1, and (85990) 1999 JV6. Before 1996, the asteroid had been on a so-called horseshoe orbit around the Sun, along the Earth's orbit. After 2006, it had regained such an orbit. This makes it very similar to 2002 AA29, which will become a quasi-satellite of Earth in approximately 600 years.
