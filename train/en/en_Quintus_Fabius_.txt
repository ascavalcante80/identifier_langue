Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (died 265 BC), an otherwise obscure Roman consul in 265 BC, was the son of Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges and father of the Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus.
Gurges was slain while engaged in quelling some disturbances at Vulsinii in Etruria (Cassius Dio, X.42).
His son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, was elected consul several times, was censor, and was twice dictator in 221 and 217 BC.
