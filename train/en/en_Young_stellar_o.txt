Young stellar object (YSO) denotes a star in its early stage of evolution.
This class consists of two groups of objects: protostars and pre–main-sequence stars.


== Classification by mass ==
Sometimes they are divided by mass – massive YSO (MYSO), intermediate mass YSO and brown dwarfs.


== Classification by spectral energy distribution ==
YSO are usually classified using criteria based on the slope of their SED, introduced by Lada C.J. in 1987. He proposed three classes (I, II and III), based on the values of intervals of spectral index :
.
Here  is wavelength, and  is flux density.
The  is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2–20  (near- and mid- infrared region). Later Greene et al. in 1994 added a fourth class of "flat spectrum" class sources. In 1993 Andre et al. discovered class 0—objects with strong submillimeter emission, but very faint at .
Class 0 sources – undetectable at 
Class I sources have 
Flat spectrum sources have 
Class II sources have 
Class III sources have 
This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage dissipating their circumstellar envelopes. Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as pre–main sequence stars.


== Characteristics ==
YSO are also associated with early star evolution phenomena: jets and bipolar outflows, masers, Herbig–Haro objects, and protoplanetary disks (circumstellar disks or proplyds).
