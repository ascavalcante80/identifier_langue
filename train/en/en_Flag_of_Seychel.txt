The flag of Seychelles was adopted on January 8, 1996. The current flag is the third used by the country since its independence from Britain on June 29, 1976.

The flag consists of five different coloured bands (green, white, red, yellow and blue) starting from one end and diverging towards the other end.

The green depicts the land and natural environment.
