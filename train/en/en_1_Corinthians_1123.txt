== Verse 12 ==
New King James Version
For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. 
For as the body is one
That is, a human body; for of this the apostle speaks, and takes a simile, and forms a comparison from, showing the union among saints, and their mutual participation of the various gifts of the Spirit; for a human body is but one body, and not more.
And has many members;
as eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc.
And all the members of that one body, being many, are one body;
as numerous as they may be, they all belong to, and make up but one body; performing different offices, for which they are naturally fitted for the good of the whole:
so also to Christ;
not personal, but mystical; not the head alone, or the members by themselves, but head and members as constituting one body, the church. The church, in union with Christ, the head, is but one general assembly, and church of the firstborn written in heaven, though consisting of the various persons of God's elect, who are closely united one to another, and their head Christ; and therefore are denominated from him, and called by his name; see (Romans 9:3) (Jeremiah 33:16).
