In the APG II system (2003) for the classification of flowering plants, the name asterids denotes a clade (a monophyletic group). Common examples include the forget-me-nots, nightshades, potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, peppers, tobacco, petunias, morning glory, sweet potato, coffee, lavender, lilac, olive, jasmine, honeysuckle, ash tree, teak, snapdragon, sesame, psyllium, garden sage, and a number of table herbs such as mint, basil, and rosemary.
Most of the taxa belonging to this clade had been referred to the Asteridae in the Cronquist system (1981) and to the Sympetalae in earlier systems. The name asterids (not necessarily capitalised) resembles the earlier botanical name but is intended to be the name of a clade rather than a formal ranked name, in the sense of the ICBN. This clade is one of the two most speciose groups of eudicots, the other being the rosids. It consists of:
clade asterids:

order Cornales
order Ericales

clade euasterids I

family Boraginaceae
family Icacinaceae
family Oncothecaceae
family Vahliaceae

order Garryales
order Solanales
order Gentianales
order Lamiales

clade euasterids II

family Bruniaceae
family Columelliaceae (+ family Desfontainiaceae)
family Eremosynaceae
family Escalloniaceae (+ family Tribelaceae)
family Paracryphiaceae (+ families Sphenostemonaceae and Quintiniaceae)
family Polyosmaceae

order Aquifoliales
order Apiales
order Dipsacales
order Asterales

Note: “ + ....” = optional as a segregate of the preceding family.
