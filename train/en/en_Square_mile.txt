The square mile (abbreviated as sq mi and sometimes as mi2) is an imperial and US unit of measure for an area equal to the area of a square of one statute mile. It should not be confused with miles square, which refers to the number of miles on each side squared. For instance, 20 miles square (20 × 20 miles) is equal to 400 square miles; an area of 10 × 40 miles is likewise 400 square miles, but it is not 20 miles square.
One square mile is equal to:
4,014,489,600 square inches
27,878,400 square feet
3,097,600 square yards
640 acres
2560 roods
A square mile is equivalent to the following metric system measures:-
25,899,881,103.36 square centimetres
2,589,988.110336 square metres
258.9988110336 hectares
2.589988110336 square kilometres
When applied to a portion of the earth's surface, which is curved rather than flat, "square mile" is an informal synonym for section.
Romans derived measurements from marching. Five feet was equal to one pace (which is appropriately a double step). 1,000 paces measured a Roman mile which is very close to the British mile as used in 21st century. This Roman system was adopted, with local variations, throughout Europe as the Roman Empire spread.
Total population in a square mile is derived by dividing the total number of residents by the number of square miles of land area in the specified geographic area. The population per square kilometer is derived by multiplying the population per square mile by .3861.
