Squash blossoms are the edible flowers of Cucurbita species, particularly Cucurbita pepo, the species that produces zucchini (courgette), marrow, spaghetti squash, and many other types of squash.


== Availability ==
Squash blossoms are highly perishable, and as such are rarely stocked in supermarkets. Male and female squash blossoms can be used interchangeably, but picking only male flowers (leaving some for pollination) allows the plant to also produce some fruit (squash).


== Culinary uses ==
Squash blossoms may be stuffed, battered and fried, or made into soup.
