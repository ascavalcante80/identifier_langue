York University is a York Region Transit (YRT) bus terminal on Ian Macdonald Boulevard near York Boulevard in York Commons (right outside of the Archives of Ontario), within the main Keele Campus of York University in Toronto, Canada.
Despite being geographically south of York Region, the YRT fare system treats the terminal as if it were in York Region. Therefore, passengers can alight from a northbound bus originating at Downsview Station, and passengers can board a southbound route from this terminal. This policy is intended to allow transfers between Viva Orange and Viva Purple. In addition, TTC transfers and passes are accepted as proof of payment between Downsview Station and York University as an attempt to reduce overcrowding on TTC route 196 York University Rocket.
When the Spadina subway line is extended to York University, Black Creek Pioneer Village and Vaughan Centre, the Viva Orange line will be combined with the Viva Purple line, and Viva bus service to York University will be discontinued.
