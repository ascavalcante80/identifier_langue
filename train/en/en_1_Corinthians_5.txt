== Verse 6 ==
New King James Version
Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
Your glorying is not good
Their glorying in their outward flourishing condition, in their riches and wealth, and in their ministers, in their wisdom and parts when under such an humbling dispensation; and especially if their glorying was in the sin itself, and their connivance at it, it was far from being good, it was very criminal, as the consequence of it was dangerous.
Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
This, in nature, is what everybody knows; and the proverb, which is much used by the Jews, was common in the mouths of all, and the meaning of it easy to be understood: thus, whether applied to the leaven of false doctrine, nothing is more manifest, than when this is let alone, and a stop is not put to it, it increases to more ungodliness; or to vice and immorality, as here; which if not taken notice of by a church, is not faithfully reproved and severely censured, as the case requires, will endanger the whole community; it may spread by example, and, under the connivance of the church, to the corrupting of good manners, and infecting of many.


== Verse 13 ==
New King James Version
But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.”
