The Region of Maradi is one of seven Regions of Niger. It is located in south-center Niger, east of the Region of Tahoua, west of Zinder, and north of Nigeria's city of Kano. The administrative center is at Maradi. The population of the Region is majority Hausa.


== Geography ==
Most of the 35,100 km² of land is classified as "Sahel", though the northern parts head toward desert, and the very southern edges along the border with Nigeria get almost 600 mm a year in average rainfall, with some areas receiving as much as 650–700 mm in better years.


== Economy ==
The Maradi (Niger)-Nigeria border dips south below the Region's capital, forming an area sometimes called the "breadbasket" of Niger. While Tobacco, mangoes, wheat, soy beans and even cotton are cultivated in some areas, most crops are groundnuts grown as a commercial crop, and the national subsistence of millet, sorghum and cow peas.


== Population ==
Culturally, the Maradi Region forms the west central section of Nigerien Hausaland, which extends along the Nigeria border (and south) west to Dogondoutchi and east to just beyond Zinder. As well, minority populations of Fula people (including but not limited to the Wodaabe who predominate to the north and east of the region), Bozo people, ans well as Tuareg and dependent groups, especially in the north of the region and in spots along trade routes. It is the most densely populated region of Niger.
