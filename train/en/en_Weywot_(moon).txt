Weywot, officially (50000) Quaoar I Weywot, is the only known moon of the trans-Neptunian object Quaoar. Its discovery by Michael E. Brown was reported in IAUC 8812 on 22 February 2007, based on imagery taken on 14 February 2006. The satellite was found at 0.35 arcsec from Quaoar with an apparent magnitude difference of 5.6. It orbits at a distance of 14,500 km from the primary and has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.14. Assuming an equal albedo and density to the primary, the apparent magnitude suggests that the moon has a diameter of about 74 km (1⁄12 of Quaoar). Weywot is estimated to only have 1⁄2000 the mass of Quaoar.
