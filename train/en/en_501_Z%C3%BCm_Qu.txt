501 Zum Queen is a rapid transit route in Brampton, Ontario. The first corridor, which began service on September 20, 2010, runs between the Downtown Brampton Terminal in the west to its easterly terminus at York University in the City of Toronto. Routes 501 and 501A operate east along Queen Street in Brampton. Route 501 (full service, every 15 minutes peak, every 20 minutes off-peak, and 30 minutes on weekends) continues along Highway 7 through the City of Vaughan and then south on Jane Street to York University. Route 501A runs express through Vaughan to York University via Highway 407 during peak periods. This covers the eastern segment of existing Route 1, and replaces Brampton's portion of the former Route 77 and Route 77A to York University, and the temporary Route 177/177A Highway 7 Express. Route 501 stops at all Viva Orange stops in Vaughan; running nearly the same frequency as Viva Orange, it covers its entire route except for the segment between York University and Downsview Subway Station that is primarily served by TTC express route 196 every 2â€“15 minutes. Route 501A replaces and expands the 77A express branch via Highways 427 and 407. During rush hours it runs at 15-minute intervals, providing a combined 7.5-minute service between Highway 427 and Downtown Brampton, and limited midday service on Route 501A was introduced in September 2011.
