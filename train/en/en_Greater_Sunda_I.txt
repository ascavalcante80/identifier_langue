The Greater Sunda Islands are a group of large islands within the Malay Archipelago. Many are included in present-day Indonesia: Java, smallest but by far the most populous; Sumatra in the west, directly across the Strait of Malacca from Malaysia; large Borneo, the Indonesian sector of which is called Kalimantan; and wishbone-shaped, distended Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) to the east.
