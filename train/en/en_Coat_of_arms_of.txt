Tuvalu's coat of arms, approved by the College of Arms (also known as the College of Heralds), was granted by Royal Warrant on 3 December 1976. The top image contains in fine print the actual descriptive text for the Tuvalu Coat of Arms, as per the Escutcheon, for the purpose of authenticity. (The slightly different color hues between the two crest images is the result of two different scanning devices. The top image's coloration is closest to that of the actual hard copy Royal Warrant; however, both scanned coloration's are acceptable for and in official use.)
All other depictions of the Tuvalu coat of arms ("crest"), except for those shown here, are unofficial and incorrect.
The state motto, Tuvalu mo te Atua (Tuvalu for the Almighty), also serves as the title of the national anthem.


== Explanatory Note ==
The image of the Tuvalu crest previously posted on this page - and elsewhere - entered the popular domain, via website postings, in the mid-late 1990s. Its origin is unknown. Unfortunately, its usage - though incorrect - is common. In fact, images of the incorrect Tuvalu crest are so pervasive across the Internet it has become a 'factoid', something believed to be true, or correct, because it appears in print or other media so often it becomes accepted as fact, but in fact is not the correct and officially sanctioned Tuvalu Coat of Arms. The original and official Tuvalu Coat of Arms depicted here, approved by the College of Arms in December 1976, including all official supporting documentation, is lodged with the Tuvalu National Archives, Tuvalu Government, Vaiaku, Funafuti, Tuvalu.
