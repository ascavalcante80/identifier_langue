The flag of the Central African Republic was adopted on December 1, 1958. It was designed by Barth√©lemy Boganda, the first president of the autonomous territory of Oubangui-Chari, who believed that "France and Africa must march together." Thus he combined the blue, white and red of the French tricolour and the Pan-African colors red, green and yellow.
From 1976 to 1979, during the existence of the Central African Empire, an imperial standard was designed for Emperor Bokassa I's personal use. The standard was light green in color, with a gold-colored eagle in the centre superimposed over a 20-pointed gold star, inspired by the eagle on the imperial standard of Napoleon I. The nation's flag, however, remained unchanged.


== Colors and symbolism ==

According to its official description, red symbolizes the blood of the people of the nation, the blood that was spilt in order to bring it independence, and the blood that they would spill to protect their nation. Blue represents the sky and freedom. White represents peace, and dignity. Green represents hope, and faith. Yellow represents tolerance.
The star guides the steps of the Central African people towards freedom and emancipation. The star is taken from that of MESAN (Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa), the ruling party of Central Africa from independence in August 1960 until the overthrow of General Bokassa in September 1979.
Note that for all flags, several meanings are taken. The most common meanings for this flag are as follows. The colors blue, white, and red are taken from the flag of France. Green, red, and yellow are also pan-African colors, seen on the pan-African flag and taken from the flag of Ethiopia, one of the few independent countries in Africa during the colonial period.
The colors can also correspond to the Central African Republic and
