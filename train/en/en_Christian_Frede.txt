Christiaan Beyers (23 September 1869 â€“ 8 December 1914) was a Boer general during the Second Boer War.

In this letter he declared that he had always disapproved the Government's intention to invade German South West Africa and that this disapproval was shared by the great majority of the Dutch-speaking people of the Union. General Smuts replied in a stern letter declaring that the war was a test of the loyalty to their pledged word of the Dutch-speaking people, and accepting Beyers' res
