Zeebrugge (Dutch pronunciation: [zeːˈbrʏɣə], from: Brugge aan zee meaning "Bruges on Sea", French: Zeebruges) is a village on the coast of Belgium and a subdivision of Bruges, for which it is the modern port. Zeebrugge serves as both the international port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and a seafront resort with hotels, cafés, a marina and a beach.

Located on the coast of the North Sea, its central location on the Belgian coast, short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make Zeebrugge a crossroads for traffic from all directions. An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram.
It is Belgium's most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe.

Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe.
